# lettria-test
  A small API that inserts authors and messages into a Mongo database.
  Two collections are used, they are linked to each other via references.

## Getting started
  MongoDB needs to be already started.
  To install dependancies :
  ```
  npm install
  ```
  To start the API :
  ```
  npm start
  ```
  Then you can use curl or postman(data needs to be formatted as Raw-data JSON) to test it.
